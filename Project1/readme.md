# Project 1: End-to-End Pipeline to Classify News Articles

Built an end-to-end pipeline to classify samples of news articles which involved the following ML components:
1. Feature Extraction: Construction of TF-IDF representations of textual data;
2. Dimensionality Reduction: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) 
3. Application of Simple Classification Models: Applying common classification methods to the extracted features such as Logistic/Linear Classification and Support Vector Machines;
4. Evaluation the Pipeline: Evaluating and diagnosing classification results using Grid-Search and Cross Validation;
5. Replace corpus-level features with pretrained features: To apply pre-training to downstream classification task and evaluate comparative performance.
